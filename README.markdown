# Raphaël

This library is a an experimental rewrite of Raphaël into CoffeeScript. The primary intention is to experiment with and learn CoffeeScript. If all goes well it may lead on to the following goals:

 * Divide the code into more discreet classes
 * Improve documentation
 * Write tests

Cross-browser vector graphics the easy way. Visit the library website for more information: [http://raphaeljs.com](http://raphaeljs.com/)
